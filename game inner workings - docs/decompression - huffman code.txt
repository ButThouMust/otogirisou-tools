Otogirisou stores the text for its script in compressed Huffman code format:

Location of the Huffman trees' data:
- Left  subtree data: 0x141E1 - 0x14D4E.
- Right subtree data: 0x14D4F - 0x158BC

Location of the script space: 0xAE401 - 0xF95A8

It also mixes in script pointers with the text for JMP codes and choices.
See "script pointer decompression.txt" for more info.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic idea: the game uses the data in the script space as inputs to the Huffman
trees. It reads one bit at a time until it reaches a leaf node in the tree, at
which point it determines what two-byte value (character, control code, code
input, etc.) is being decompressed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure of the Huffman trees:
Each entry (I will also refer to entries as "subtrees" or "nodes") in the
Huffman tree is a two byte value. There are 0x5B7 entries in each tree space.
The root of the tree is the very last entry for each tree space.

In the ROM, you can think of each tree space as an array of 0x5B7 entries.
Indexing from zero, the array offset lets you determine the ROM offset by doing:
- left  = 0x141E1 + 2 * index
- right = 0x14D4F + 2 * index

Example: the root of the tree is entry 0x5B6.
- root's left  subtree entry is at: 0x141E1 + 2 * 0x5B6 = 0x14D4D
- root's right subtree entry is at: 0x14D4F + 2 * 0x5B6 = 0x158BB

There are two kinds of tree nodes that these entry values can represent:
- leaf nodes:  a node that does not connect to any nodes "below" it
- inner nodes: a node that connects to at least one node "below" it

     root     Conceptually, this is what the Huffman tree structure looks like.
    /    \    Here, root, 1, and 2 are inner nodes. 3, 4, 5 are leaf nodes.
   1      2
  / \    / 
 3   4  5   

The way to tell inner and leaf nodes apart is simple: inner nodes have a value
with an MSB of 0; leaf nodes have a value with an MSB of 1. In practice, leaf
node values start with 8 or 9 in hex; inner node values start with 0 in hex.
Note that the values are little endian (1D00 in ROM = actual value of 001D).

Example: values for the tree at position 0x037 are:
left:  0x141E1 + 2 * 0x37 = 0x1424F; data is 1D00 -> 001D, an inner node
right: 0x14D4F + 2 * 0x37 = 0x14DBD; data is 5784 -> 8457, a leaf node

For inner nodes, the data is the index of the next node to look at in the tree.
For leaf nodes, the data is the character code itself, but with an MSB of 1.
Continuing with the example above:
- The left node leads you to index 0x01D.
- The right node is the character value 0x0457, which represents the kanji 胆.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the script space data with the Huffman trees

The applicable assembly code for this algorithm is in Guest's trace file
"script_0.txt", and Guest's C++ version is in Read_Huffman() in "scan.cpp".

How the game reads bits from the script space:
- read a byte from the script space into the accumulator register
- take the LSB
- if LSB = 0, use the right Huffman tree; if LSB = 1, use the left Huffman tree
  - if the data you get is an inner node, continue traversing the trees
  - if the data you get is a leaf node, you have your character data value
- right shift the copy of the byte in memory, and repeat with next LSB
- after every 8 bits, read another byte (Guest calls this "reload barrel")

You will always start at the root with each new character.

This process is perhaps best illustrated by example, and two are below.

In effect, this means that if you know the Huffman code, you would need to take
the data in the script space and reverse the bit order if you want to read stuff
out at a glance. For example, if a byte in the script space is 0x87 (1000 0111),
you would have to reverse it to 0xE1 (1110 0001).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of decompressing characters from the script space

A very common word in the game is the name of the protagonist's girlfriend, 奈美
"Nami". If you search for [15E63A-1] in the script dump, you can see that her
name is the first two characters at this particular offset. Let's do an example
with her name 奈美.

First, convert the RAM address 15E63A to a ROM address:
ROM addr = (15 - 1) * 0x8000 + 0xE63A = 0xAE63A

The first two bytes at 0xAE63A are 11 EC:
11     v  EC        | Start at bit offset 1 (bit 7 = MSB; bit 0 = LSB; 76543210)
0001 0001 1110 1100 | I mark the bit offset with the "v" at left.

To make the process easier to understand, let's reverse the bits to account for
the "reverse" bit order.
88        37        | We start reading bits at the "^".
1000 1000 0011 0111 | Start navigating the Huffman tree at the root.
 ^                  | I only reversed the bit order i.e. 76543210 -> 01234567

The root is at offset 0x5B6:
- root's left subtree is at:  0x141E1 + 2 * 0x5B6 = 0x14D4D
- root's right subtree is at: 0x14D4F + 2 * 0x5B6 = 0x158BB

For this example, I will leave out the offset calculations.
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5B6 (0x158BB) = B405 -> 05B4; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5B4 (0x158B7) = B005 -> 05B0; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5B0 (0x158AF) = A805 -> 05A8; inner node
1: Left  Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5A8 (0x14D31) = 9905 -> 0599; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x599 (0x15881) = 8105 -> 0581; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x581 (0x15851) = 8482 -> 8284; leaf!

The code is 6 bits long: 000100. If you zero out the MSB of the data value, it
is 0284, which checks out with the table value for the character "奈". Also, a
good sanity check: the offsets monotonically decrease while you calculate them.

Repeat the exercise for the next character "美" (table value 00E7). Notice that
the next four bits (start at0xAE63A-7) are 0001, same as "奈". In this case, we
can copy/paste our previous work here, and continue with the different bit, 1:
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5B6 (0x158BB) = B405 -> 05B4; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5B4 (0x158B7) = B005 -> 05B0; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5B0 (0x158AF) = A805 -> 05A8; inner node
1: Left  Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x5A8 (0x14D31) = 9905 -> 0599; inner node
1: Left  Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x599 (0x14D13) = 8205 -> 0582; inner node
0: Right Huffman tree; data @ offset 0x582 (0x15853) = E780 -> 80E7; leaf!

The code is also 6 bits long: 000110. Zero out MSB, 80E7 -> 00E7, checks out.
For some reference, with the original Japanese script, the shortest Huffman
codes are 5 bits long, and the longest are 19 bits long.

Obtaining Huffman codes directly from the Huffman tree

It is possible to get Huffman codes from only the Huffman tree, without using
the script space. My program that dumps out all the Huffman codes traverses the
entire tree and keeps track of the bits for the "Huffman code so far," so to
speak.

I personally think the method below is more error prone (at least, if you're
doing it by hand), but I came up with it as a second way to check my work.

Let's say you have a character's table value and want to know its Huffman code.
First, you have to check if it is even in the Huffman tree. There are characters
that do not have Huffman codes i.e. don't appear in the script, such as most of
the English alphabet.

Simply take your table value, set the MSB to 1, and search for it in the Huffman
tree spaces. Make sure to turn it into a little endian value. It could be in the
left subtree data, the right subtree data, or not at all. (Offset should be odd)

Example: The period character "。" has table value 05C7.
Set MSB -> 85C7, little endian -> C785.
If you search for C785 in the Huffman tree data, it is at 0x15891.

Use the reverse formulas to get the index that points to this location.
- left  = 0x141E1 + 2 * index; index = (left  - 0x141E1) / 2
- right = 0x14D4F + 2 * index; index = (right - 0x14D4F) / 2

Start at 0x15891. This is within the right subtree's data (see top of file).
index = (0x15891 - 0x14D4F) / 2 = 0x5A1. Convert to a little endian value, A105.
This value is at 0x14D30. Repeat with the indices you get until you reach the
root, either 0x14D4D for the left or 0x158BB for the right.

C785 is @ 0x15891. Right subtree (0). index = (0x15891 - 0x14D4F) / 2 = 0x5A1.
A105 is @ 0x14D39. Left subtree  (1). index = (0x14D39 - 0x141E1) / 2 = 0x5AC.
AC05 is @ 0x158B3. Right subtree (0). index = (0x158B3 - 0x14D4F) / 2 = 0x5B2.
B205 is @ 0x158B9. Right subtree (0). index = (0x158B9 - 0x14D4F) / 2 = 0x5B5.
B505 is @ 0x14D4D. Left subtree  (1) for the root, so we are done.

If you work backwards, the Huffman code is 10010.
Similar sanity check: for reverse method, offsets should monotonically increase.

Creating a Huffman tree from a script translation

Huffman coding is a known compression format for which you can easily find
implementations online. Should you wish to reuse the Huffman compression in a
translation patch, here are some insights I found with the process.

- At the heart of Huffman coding is knowing the number of occurrences for each
  character in the text string's alphabet. In this case, you need the counts for
  each character, control code, and control code argument. That Guest had dumped
  the Japanese script as an Atlas file means that we can use Atlas as a text
  parser and table file format converter, and then iterate over the script in
  its uncompressed two byte encoding to count characters.
  
- After generating a Huffman tree structure, you will have to "flatten" it out
  and convert it to the correct game format. To do this, use a queue to do a
  breadth-first traversal to assign a unique integer to the non-leaf nodes. This
  integer represents an array index to either the left or right subtrees' data
  at a particular point in the tree.
